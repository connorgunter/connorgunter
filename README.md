Welcome to my GitHub 😁

I am currently a student at General Assembly in the Software Engineering Immersive course! 🧠

This will be a good look at my progress throughout the course and my further studies 📈

I'm currently learning all about the DOM in JS 🤔

Languages I use! 🤖
- HTML -> Structure of a WebPage
- CSS -> To make it look pretty
- JavaScript -> To make it interactive!

Fun Fact about me -> I have 2 kittens named Lilo and Stitch and they keep me busy when I am not coding!🐈
